# Code Refractoring: HTML-CSS-Git-Code-Refactor-MWS
<h3>Description</h3>
<ul>
    <li> WHAT: Horiseon, a marketing agency, has a base static website that was in need of refractoring.</li>
    <li> WHY: In order for Horiseon to use this same code for long term sustainability and meet accessibility standards, it needed to follow semantic HTML, logical structure independent of styling and positioning, and to be optimized for search engines. </li> 
    <li> HOW: For the first refractor, I went with basic HTML and CSS to provide a foundation to build from.</li>  
    <li> MOTIVATION: Asked to take the first try at refractoring this code, I was glad to jump in and help.</li> 
    <li> BUILD: HTML and CSS</li>   
    <li> PROBLEM: The original code worked functionally, but needed some tweaks to become the base for future code.</li>   
    <li> LEARNINGS: Sometimes functional code can still be cleaned up and produce the same visual results.</li> 
</ul>

<h3>Installation</h3>
STEPS: Given the HTML and CSS code from client Horiseon, I was able to us VS Code and refractor the basic static website for future building and usage. To see the web page, use default browser to see how the HTML and CSS renders on the page.

<h3>Usage</h3>
This is the first draft of Horiseon's web page written in HTML and CSS. If more web pages are nexeccary, consider this the new base to buidl from.

<h3>Credits</h3>
Thanks to Molly Gilbert and Jeff Cartagena for giving the first draft of Horiseon's HTML and CSS static base web code and having me refactor it.
